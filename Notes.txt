Seller must be made first,
Then a seller location. This is done independent of buyer.

A buyer needs to be made independent of the seller.

Once buyer and seller exist, they can have a transaction. Items wil be placed in the database before the transaction, but to a user standpoint they need to happen at the same time.

Next step is to build these functionalities in python connecting to the db:
	Create Seller
	create seller location

	create buyer

	create transaction/items
